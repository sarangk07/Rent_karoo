    <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
    <p>
        Creating terms and conditions, as well as a damage policy, for your rent-a-car site is an important step to
        clarify the rules and responsibilities for both you (the car rental service provider) and your customers. Below are
        some sample terms and conditions and a damage policy. Note that you should tailor these to fit the specifics of
        your business and comply with local laws and regulations.
    </p>

                <li>The agreement is binding once the customer picks up the vehicle.</li>
            </ul>

        <li><strong>Reservation and Cancellation:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Reservations are subject to availability.</li>

                    documented.</li>
            </ul>

            </ul>

        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Remember to consult with legal professionals to ensure that your terms and conditions comply with local laws and
        regulations. It's also a good practice to have customers acknowledge their understanding and acceptance of these
        terms by signing the rental agreement.
